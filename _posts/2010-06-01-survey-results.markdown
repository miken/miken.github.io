[surveyresults.org](https://www.surveyresults.org/) is [the Center for Effective Philanthropy](http://www.effectivephilanthropy.org)'s online reporting platform that delivers results of stakeholder surveys to foundation clients. In my product management role, I plan annual development budget, coordinate development sprints with both non-technical and technical teams, and set directions for future development based on user analytics and feedback.

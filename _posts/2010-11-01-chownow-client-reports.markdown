During my MBA, I spent 16 months interning at [ChowNow](http://www.chownow.com/) as a data analytics intern recommending operations strategies based on clients' ordering data. I built an analytics product that generates quarterly PDF reports showing clients' ordering performance on ChowNow's platform.

Inspired by [Treasury's move to replace Alexander Hamilton with a woman on the new $10 bill](http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/06/17/us/politics/ap-us-woman-on-money.html), I built [tendollars.me](http://www.tendollars.me/), which allows users to customize the design of the $10 bill using their own images.

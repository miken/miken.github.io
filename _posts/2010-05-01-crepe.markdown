During my time at [CEP](http://www.effectivephilanthropy.org), I developed a database API that will send aggregate client survey results to CEP's online reporting platform at [surveyresults.org](https://www.surveyresults.org). Besides calculating and grouping data, crepe also generates summary of findings in natural language based on data, performs statistical analysis and generates results in interactive HTML reports. The link below will take you to a sample analysis report generated by crepe.

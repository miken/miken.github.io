During my time at [CEP](http://www.effectivephilanthropy.org), I developed crepe, a back-end database API that has many interesting features:

- It sends aggregate client survey results to CEP's online reporting platform at [surveyresults.org](https://www.surveyresults.org)
- Based on data contexts, it writes up summary of findings in natural language for clients
- It performs statistical analyses, including T-Tests and F-Tests, and generates results as interactive HTML reports

The link below will take you to a sample T-Test report generated by crepe.

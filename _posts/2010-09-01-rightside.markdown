[Rightside Shirts](http://www.rightsideshirts.org) is a t-shirt company with designs created by elementary and middle school students. 100% of their profits go directly back to these students' schools to fund art programs. [Harley](https://github.com/harley) and I built an improved platform for visitors to fund, vote, run campaigns and keep track of campaign progress. I worked primarily on articulating user experience, coding front-end design in CSS and JavaScript, and performing some harmless back-end tricks.

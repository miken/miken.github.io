description: I developed radarr, a cross-platform mobile app, as a weekend hobby project using a new JavaScript framework, <a href="https://www.meteor.com">Meteor</a>. radarr serves as a directory of local radio stations. It helps traveling listeners locate their favorite stations faster through their phone screens rather than through frequency scans.

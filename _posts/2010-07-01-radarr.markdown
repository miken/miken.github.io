I developed radarr, a cross-platform mobile app, as a weekend hobby project using a new JavaScript framework, 
[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com). radarr serves as a directory of local radio stations. It helps traveling listeners locate their favorite stations faster through their phone screens rather than through frequency scans.

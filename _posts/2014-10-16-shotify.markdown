description: Shotify was developed by a three-person team in 8 hours at Vampire Hackathon 2012, Boston. Shotify was built with Spotify Apps API. It turns any Spotify playlist into a power-hour drinking game. At the turn of every minute, the playlist will switch songs and the players drink. I designed user experience mock-ups, prioritized specs for development and prepared video pitch and copywriting materials.

During my time at [CEP](http://www.effectivephilanthropy.org), to facilitate knowledge transfer and minimize record keeping efforts, I developed an online manual for **crepe**, the back-end database API for [surveyresults.org](https://www.surveyresults.org). Using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), I can quickly add and index new articles to this documentation guide.

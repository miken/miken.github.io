                        I grew up in the tropical paradise of Vietnam. I spent my childhood writing math equations, tinkering with computer parts, and feasting on rambutans and coconuts.

                        In search of my true passion, I set foot on temperate New England, emerged with a degree in Economics from <a href="http://www.williams.edu/">Williams College</a> four years later, and found a calling in product management and software development.

                        In my day time, I manage data analytics products for a nonprofit that helps foundations make better strategic decisions.

                        In my spare time, I enjoy developing Web sites using various frameworks, from <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, to <a href="https://www.meteor.com">meteor</a>.

                        In my remaining spare time, I like cooking and rowing.

                        I enjoy building great technology products for people and organizations. If you want to discuss an interesting idea with me (it doesn't have to be about websites!), feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:mike@toch.im">mike@toch.im</a>

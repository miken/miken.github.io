                        I have fond memories of my childhood in tropical Vietnam. I spent much time solving trigonometry equations, tinkering with computers, and feasting on rambutans.

                        Since leaving home at the age of fourteen, I have lived in Singapore, Poland, and the U.S. I graduated from <a href="http://www.williams.edu/">Williams College</a> with a degree in Economics. I also graduated from breaking computer hardware to writing software. I speak several languages and program in several others.

                        During day time, I manage data analytics products for a nonprofit that helps foundations make better strategic decisions.

                        During spare time, I develop Web sites using various frameworks, from <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, to <a href="https://www.meteor.com">meteor</a>.

                        During my remaining spare time, I cook and row. I make some good pho and paella. I like the swooshing sound of an oar blade cleanly traversing water.

                        I enjoy building great technology products for people and organizations. If you have an interesting idea, <a href="mailto:mike@toch.im">share it with me</a>.
